# SVG Logos for Web Use

This repository contains a collection of SVG logos, optimized for embedding into websites.

All SVG files must be minified (e.g. with [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo)) and tested with at least the latest releases of Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, Edge and Internet Explorer 11. Ensure the attributes `width`, `height` and `viewBox` are present.

File names should follow the scheme `<name>[-<variant>].svg`, with both `name` and `variant` dasherized, the latter being optional.
